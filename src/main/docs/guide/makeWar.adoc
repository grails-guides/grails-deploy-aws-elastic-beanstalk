AWS can take either zip files or WAR files. In our case we will go with a WAR.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/
----
(or your project directory if you chose to create your own)

Next execute the following ...

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew war
----

After the command completes you should see something similar to below.

Once you have successfully generated your war file, you can find your newly generated file
located at `initial/build/libs`. The war itself will be named something similar to
`initial-0.1.war`.
