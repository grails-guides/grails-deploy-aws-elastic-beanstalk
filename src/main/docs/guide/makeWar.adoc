With our AWS account created and knowing where to find the Elastic Beanstalk we can now begin exploring this
platform in the clouds.
AWS can take either zip or WAR files for deployment. In our case we will go with a WAR.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/
----
(or your project directory if you chose to create your own)

Next execute the following ...

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew war
----

After the command completes you should see something similar to below.

Once you have successfully generated your war file, you can find your newly generated file
located at `initial/build/libs`. The war itself will be named something similar to
`initial-0.1.war`.
