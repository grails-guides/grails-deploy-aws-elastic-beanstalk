Now for a more realistic deployment to Elastic Beanstalk. In this case we will set the datasource up
from inside Elastic Beanstalk. This approach is best for dev and testing as it is quick and fairly
painless but not the most flexible later on. First we will go ahead and make the
necessary modifications to our app. Just like if we wanted to run the app with no data source go
ahead and remove the production environment block from `application.yml`. Next in the same directory
as our `application.yml`, create an `application-production.groovy` file.

Edit `grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy`: to look like the following

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy[]
----

You have probably noticed that we are making use of some environment variables, we will show you how to
set those shortly. Once you have made the above changes you will need to `WAR` your application again <<makeWar>>.

We will now go ahead and create a MySQL datasource using AWS RDS service. First navigate to RDS, located
under Database.

Selecting RDS will bring you to the RDS Dashboard. Once at the dashboard go ahead and click on
'Launch a DB Instance' to begin creating your new database.

The AWS RDS lets us quickly provision several different types of
database for our application. In our case we will select MySQL and click select.

Now we will set the initial details of the database. For `DB Instance Class` select db.t2.micro, everything
else can be left as default. Under settings create an identifier for your database along with a
username and password.

NOTE: The identifier is not the database name.

Under 'Configure Advanced Settings` we again will leave everything as default other than we will specify
our actual database name on this screen. We will call our database `myNewDB`.

Click 'Launch DB Instance'; this will start the creation of your database and bring you to the following
screen.

From the above click on 'View Your DB Instances', this will bring you to your instance view screen.

Now that our database is setup it is time to connect it to our Elastic Beanstalk instance using our
Environment Variables.

Select configuration from the left hand menu.

Select the gear on 'Software Configuration'

Scroll to the bottom and add the following environment variables with your values.

Once you have added the environment variables restart your application and it will pick up them up. To
see this check your logs.
