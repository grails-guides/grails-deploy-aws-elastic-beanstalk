Thereâ€™s plenty of opportunities to expand the scope of this application. Here are a few ideas for
improvements you can make on your own:

- Create a UI for better data visualization (feel free to look at the UI in the other guides mentioned
at the start of this guide.

- Add support to save new vehicles

- Currently Makes & Models are independent. Add an appropriate GORM association between Make &
Model, and create select lists to only display Models for the currently select Make. You will
want to make use of the JavaScript Array.filter method.
