Now that we have our AWS Keys and EB CLI is installed we need to configure it and our project in order to receive the
benefits of being able to not leave the command line. Start by moving into your top level
project directory.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/
----

Next run our first EB CLI command

[source,bash]
----
$ eb init
----

First we need to select a region for our app to be deployed in, we suggest selecting the
geographic region in which you live or which will be closest to your user base.

Next if this is your first time using the EB CLI you will be asked to set up your AWS Keys
that we created in the last section.

Once you have added your keys it will now ask you to create a new application. Give it a name
of your choice, in our case we chose MyCLIApp.

Next it will ask you to select a deployment platform. By default it will try to make a suggestion

If not, choose Tomcat.

Now that you have chosen your deployment platform it will ask which version.

Finally it will ask if you want to use SSH for your instances. Select Y and follow the instructions.

We now have EB CLI setup but before we can deploy we still need to create a new environment
for our application.

[source,bash]
----
$ eb create
----

Give the app a name and DNS CNAME prefix (in our case we just chose the defaults). When asked to
`Select a load balancer type` again we chose the default but please evaluate based on your
application needs. Once those selections are complete, sit back and wait a few minutes till
the environment has been fully created.

If you wish to validate your specific deployment artifact you can check by viewing
`initial/.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml`

You should see

[source,bash]
----
deploy:
  artifact: /YOUR-PATH/initial/build/libs/complete-0.1.war
----

Everything is now in place to deploy our app from the command line. From our top level
project directory.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial
$ eb deploy MyCLIApp-dev
----

The above command is telling the EB CLI to deploy the app listed in the config.yml to the
environment we just created.

At this point return to your Elastic Beanstalk Dashboard to view the running instance and get the url of
the successfully deployed application.

We have defeated the giant AWS and cut down the Elastic Beanstalk into simple easy to understand pieces, lets take
a moment to revel in our reward of a fully deployed Grails app in the cloud!!!
