At this point we have a couple of options to discuss before we get to our actual deployment.

- Deploy an app with no datasource to quickly see how Elastic Beanstalk works. (Quick) <<deployTypeOne>>
- Configure a datasource from inside Elastic Beanstalk (Good for Dev) <<datasourceConfig>>
- Configure a external datasource from AWS RDS (Production)


TIP: All data source config options will require the you to edit `application.yml` as in section <<noDatasource>>

//for a more production like deployment. (We will do this in the <<datasourceConfig>> section)
