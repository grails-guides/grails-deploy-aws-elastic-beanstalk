At this point we have a couple of options to discuss before we get to our actual deployment.

- Deploy an app with default datasource (H2) to quickly see how Elastic Beanstalk works. (Quick) <<deployTypeOne>>
- Configure a datasource from inside Elastic Beanstalk (Good for Dev) <<datasourceConfig>>
- Configure a external datasource from AWS RDS (Production)


TIP: Data source config options may require you to edit `application.yml`

//for a more production like deployment. (We will do this in the <<datasourceConfig>> section)
