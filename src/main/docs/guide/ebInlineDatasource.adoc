Now for a more realistic deployment to Elastic Beanstalk. In this case we will set the datasource up
from inside Elastic Beanstalk. This approach is best for dev and testing as it is quick and fairly
painless but not the most flexible later on. First we will go ahead and make the
necessary modifications to our app. Just like if we wanted to run the app with no data source go
ahead and remove the production environment block from `application.yml`. Next in the same directory
as our `application.yml`, create an `application-production.groovy` file.

Edit `grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy`: to look like the following

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy[]
----

You have probably noticed that we are making use of some environment variables; creating the database
through Elastic Beanstalk automatically creates these for you but we will show you where they are set
as you will need to manually do it if you create you database outside of Elastic Beanstalk.
Once you have made the above changes you will need to `WAR` your application
 again <<makeWar>>.

When creating the datasource through elastic beanstalk you can create it at the time you are standing
up your application or after. In our case we will creating while creating our new application.

First click on the `Get started` button on the Elastic Beanstalk home page.

This will bring us to the 'Create a web app' page

Now we will fill in the details of our app. Set the Application Name to a name of your choice (in our case MyApp) then set
the Environment name, again whatever you would like is fine (we used Example). Next set your domain, you can allow it to
use fully generated names but for simplicity we used My-App.

NOTE: Make sure to `Check availability` for the domain you wish to use.

Following setting the domain select Tomcat as your `Platform`.

Once you have all the basic configuration set up select `Upload your code` and click `Upload`.

Now click on the `Configure more options' button.

You will now see all the additional options that could be configured but we are only interested in a
database. Scroll to the bottom where you see the `Database` box and click `Modify`.

NOTE: This is one of the locations you can set the Environment Variables. In the `Software` box click
modify and scroll to the bottom where it says Environment properties.

Go ahead and create a database with the following settings and assign it a username and password.

TIP: Make sure to note your username and password.

Click save, review your database settings and select `Create environment`.

After the button has been clicked it will take several minutes to deploy your new application. You will see a screen
similar to the following.

Once the deploy has completed you should see the status of your running application. If everything went as planned you will
see something similar to the following.

Now with the app now deployed if you needed to make edits to your environment variables select
`Configuration` from the left hand menu, then click the gear on `Software Configuration`.

After clicking the gear scroll to the bottom of the page to set environment properties.
