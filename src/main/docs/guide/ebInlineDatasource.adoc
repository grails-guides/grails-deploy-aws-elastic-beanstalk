Now for a more realistic deployment to Elastic Beanstalk. In this case we will set the datasource up
from inside Elastic Beanstalk. This approach is best for dev and testing as it is quick and fairly
painless but not the most flexible later on. First we will go ahead and make the
necessary modifications to our app.

NOTE: This assumes a new deploy from scratch.

Just like if we wanted to run the app with no data source go
ahead and remove the production environment block from `application.yml`. Next in the same directory
as our `application.yml`, create an `application-production.groovy` file.

Edit `grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy`: to look like the following

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy[]
----

You have probably noticed that we are making use of some environment variables; creating the database
through Elastic Beanstalk automatically creates these for you but we will show you where they are set
as you will need to manually do it, if you create you database outside of Elastic Beanstalk.
Once you have made the above changes you will need to `WAR` your application
 again <<makeWar>>.

When creating the datasource through elastic beanstalk you can create it at the time you are standing
up your application or after. In our case we will creating while creating our new application.

Make sure you select `Tomcat` and then click on the `Launch Now` button on the Elastic Beanstalk home page.

After a few minutes of setup, this will bring us to our Tomcat dashboard.

At this point select `Configuration` from the left side menu. Once on the configuration screen, go to the bottom and
select `create a new RDS database`.

Once on the create database page just select the defaults and enter a user name `admin` and click apply.

Creating a database will take about 10 minutes so while your waiting you can review the documentation on how to access
the environment variables
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.db.html?icmpid=docs_elasticbeanstalk_console[here].

Once you have all the basic configuration set up select `Upload and Deploy` and click `Upload`.

Once the deploy has completed you should see the status of your running application. If everything went as planned you will
see something similar to the following.

Now with the app now deployed if you needed to make edits to your environment variables select
`Configuration` from the left hand menu, then click the gear on `Software Configuration`.

After clicking the gear scroll to the bottom of the page to set environment properties.
