For our next trip up the beanstalk we are going to retrieve the Goose that lays more advanced
deployment eggs and are going to install the Aws Elastic Beanstalk CLI interface
so that we can do deployment directly from our terminal. Start by returning to the
Elastic Beanstalk home page by clicking `All Applications`.

Once we have returned, on the left hand side there is a link for `Installing the AWS EB CLI`.

At this point follow the Amazon instructions on how to install the AWS EB CLI found
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html?icmpid=docs_elasticbeanstalk_console[here]
as all the details are beyond the scope of this guide.
For OS specific instructions scroll to the bottom of the aforementioned page to find links to the
necessary Amazon documentation. Once installation has been completed the guide will resume.
