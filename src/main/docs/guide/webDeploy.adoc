Now that we have a war file ready to deploy lets return to climbing that beanstalk!

First click on the `Get started` button on the Elastic Beanstalk home page.

This will bring us to the 'Create a web app' page

Now we will fill in the details of our app. Set the Application Name to a name of your choice (in our case MyApp) then set
the Environment name, again whatever you would like is fine (we used Example). Next set your domain, you can allow it to
use fully generated names but for simplicity we used My-App.

NOTE: Make sure to `Check availability` for the domain you wish to use.

Following setting the domain select Tomcat as your `Platform`.

Once you have all the basic configuration set up select `Upload your code` and click `Upload`.

From the above page select `Local file` then click choose file. Once the file selector popup opens, navigate your your war's
location and select the file. If you are using our initial project that location will be  `initial/build/libs`. Once you have
selected your file click `Upload`, when it is done uploading you will be returned the 'Create a web app' page. Click the
`Create application` button.

After the button has been clicked it will take several minutes to deploy your new application. You will see a screen
similar to the following.

Once the deploy has completed you should see the status of your running application. If everything went as planned you will
see something similar to the following.

From here you can redeploy using the `Upload and Deploy` button, change the version of Tomcat that is being used. Check your app
logs and see monitoring and other app details. Also at the top of the page is the url which your app is running at, click it and
visit your running app.

TIP: If you have had issues and your app is not running properly, check the logs as sometimes your app may appear to be ok and have a
green check-mark but when attempting to visit the site it wont resolve. Many times an issue may be uncovered when trying to
resolve an problem by looking in the logs.

Now that we have defeated the giant AWS and cut down the Elastic Beanstalk into simple easy to understand pieces lets take
a moment to revel in our treasure of a Grails app fully deployed in the cloud!!! But let us not rest on our laurels just because
we have managed to defeat the giant and successfully chopped down the beanstalk. In the next section we will look at setting up
the Elastic Beanstalk CLI and being able to do everything we just accomplished using the UI with the terminal as well.
