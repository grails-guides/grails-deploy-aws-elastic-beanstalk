Now that we have a war file ready to deploy lets return to climbing that beanstalk!

From the Elastic Beanstalk home page, first we need to select our platform

Then click `Launch Now` button on the Elastic Beanstalk home page.

After a few minutes of setup, this will bring us to our Tomcat dashboard.

Now that your environment is created, click on "Upload and Deploy" to upload your code.

From the above page click choose file. Once the file selector popup opens, navigate your your war's
location and select the file. If you are using our initial project that location will be  `initial/build/libs`. Once you
have selected your file click `Deploy`.

After the button has been clicked it will take several minutes to deploy your new application. You will see a screen
similar to the following.

Once the deploy has completed you should see the status of your running application. If everything went as planned you will
see something similar to the following.

From here you can redeploy using the `Upload and Deploy` button, change the version of Tomcat that is being used. Check your app
logs and see monitoring and other app details. Also at the top of the page is the url which your app is running at, click it and
visit your running app.

TIP: If you have had issues and your app is not running properly, check the logs as sometimes your app may appear to be ok and have a
green check-mark but when attempting to visit the site it wont resolve. Many times an issue may be uncovered when trying to
resolve an problem by looking in the logs.

//But wait there's more, in the next section we will look at setting up
//the Elastic Beanstalk CLI and being able to do everything we just accomplished using the UI
// with the terminal as well. Time to keep chopping...
