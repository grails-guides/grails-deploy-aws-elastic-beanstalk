In addition to installing the EB CLI you will also need to have AWS Access Keys in order to
get everything working.

WARNING: While your root account does have access keys it is highly suggested you do not use
them and create a separate user account in order to generate new more secure keys.

Amazon has wonderful documentation on how to do this https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[here]
but to make this easy and simple we will quickly cover how to do this. Start by visiting
Amazons 'Identity and Access Management' https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home[dashboard] and click on `Users`.

That will bring you to the Users screen where we can `Add user`.

We will now create a new user `Jack` and grant him `Programmatic access`.

Now we will assign our new user permissions. Select `Attach existing policies directly` and
select `AdministratorAccess`.

NOTE: It is highly recommended that you rigorously evaluate what groups and policies to assign
your users. We have kept this extremely basic and simple for our guide.

Review that everything is setup as you would like for you new user and click `Create user`.

Your new user should now be setup correctly and you can make note of both your keys as we
will need them in the next section.
