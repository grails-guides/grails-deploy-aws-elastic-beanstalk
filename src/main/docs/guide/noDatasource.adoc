If you want to choose the no datasource option just to see your war running on Elastic Beanstalk, first
make sure your test app does not actually require a datasource and removed the production datasource
block from `application.yml`.

NOTE: Our test app does not require a datasource.

To ensure this deployment works without issue open your `application.yml`

Edit `grails-app/conf/application.yml`: to look like the following

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, tag=envDatasources]
----

When deploying to Elastic Beanstalk it by default runs your production environment block and since
there are no datasources configured it will throw an error. By removing this block we prevent that
error and you can quickly see how deployment works with Elastic Beanstalk.
